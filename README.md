Common Issues
=============

**Problem**: I don't own Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead on Steam, I bought it elsewhere!
**Solution**: While over all this is not a blocker to installing and running DayZ Mod, it does prevent you from installing the latest beta updates for Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead (Anything post 1.63) so you will only be able to play on servers running legacy (1.62, 1.63) versions of Operation Arrowhead. You can find 1.63 and earlier beta patches for it at the Arma 2 website http://www.arma2.com/beta-patches )

**Problem**: When I try to join my favorite server, it does not show in the server list!
**Solution**: This is likely because you are not on the same Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead version - you can see the version you are running in the bottom right corner of the Main Menu and should look like 1.64.###### (with the # being the exact revision) - Ensure you are on the Beta branch in the Betas section of the Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead properties window
